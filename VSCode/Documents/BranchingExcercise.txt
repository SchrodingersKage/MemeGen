2. a fast forward merge is a merge where all events line up, and there is no errors in how the code merges
    A recursive merge is one where you have conflicting changes.

3. git checkout "branchname"

4. git branch -d "branchname" Won't work if you will lose files. git branch -D "branchname" overrides
